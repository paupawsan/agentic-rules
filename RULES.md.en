# Agentic Rules Framework Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPLATE PROTECTION**: This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Agents MUST NOT auto-load, auto-read, or auto-process this file under any circumstances. This file is NEVER executed directly.

**VALID USAGE**: Only load this template when explicitly renamed to one of: `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` AFTER explicit user activation of framework features.

**INVALID USAGE**: Do not load this file automatically, do not reference it in startup processes, do not include it in any automated framework initialization.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION**: Agents can enhance their behavior by respecting framework configuration in `bootstrap.json` and loading rule files when corresponding settings are enabled.

## Framework Overview
This framework provides structured AI agent behaviors through modular rules:
- **memory-rules/**: Persistent memory system for context retention
- **rag-rules/**: Retrieval-augmented generation for optimal context usage
- **critical-thinking-rules/**: Intellectual rigor and hallucination prevention

## Bootstrap Compliance
Before loading any rule files, agents MUST:
1. **Check initialization status**: Detect the `.agentic_initialized` marker file using cross-platform hidden file detection (see `docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_HIDDEN_FILE_DETECTION.md`)
2. Read `bootstrap.json` to understand the framework configuration
3. Review `Bootstrap.md` for detailed algorithmic specifications and compliance requirements
4. Check loading sequence and entry points
5. Validate user consent and settings
6. Only load enabled rule integrations

## Rule Integration Requirements
Each rule provides specific algorithmic implementations that agents must actively execute:

### Memory Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `memory_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `memory-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Memory initialization, storage, retrieval, and cleanup processes
- Requires: Proper path configuration and retention policies

### RAG Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `rag_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `rag-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Context optimization, relevance scoring, and retrieval algorithms
- Requires: Context window configuration and scoring thresholds

### Critical Thinking Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `critical_thinking_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `critical-thinking-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Error admission, assumption challenge, and verification processes
- Requires: Verification thresholds and error handling settings

## Framework Integration
**FRAMEWORK DESIGN**: This framework is designed as a tool to enhance agent behavior. Framework components remain separate from user project codebases.

## Agent Enhancement
Agents using this framework can benefit from enhanced capabilities while maintaining natural interaction patterns:
- Respecting user settings and configurations when features are enabled
- Providing transparent feedback about active enhancements
- Maintaining natural, conversational communication without exposing internal mechanics
- Following framework guidance seamlessly in the background
- Enhanced accuracy and reliability through optional structured validation

**FRAMEWORK BENEFITS**: Improved agent behavior through transparent, optional enhancements that don't interfere with natural user interactions.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Always use cross-platform hidden file detection tools when checking for `.agentic_initialized` marker. Failure to do so will result in incorrect framework status detection and bootstrap compliance violations.
