# Agentic Rules Framework Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ SAFETY PRECAUTION**: This is a TEMPLATE file. Agents MUST NOT auto-load this file. Only load when renamed to `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, OR `CLAUDE.md` after explicit user activation.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**MANDATORY**: Agents must respect the bootstrap configuration in `bootstrap.json` and only load rule files when their corresponding settings are enabled.

## Framework Overview
This framework provides structured AI agent behaviors through modular rules:
- **memory-rules/**: Persistent memory system for context retention
- **rag-rules/**: Retrieval-augmented generation for optimal context usage
- **critical-thinking-rules/**: Intellectual rigor and hallucination prevention

## Bootstrap Compliance
Before loading any rule files, agents MUST:
1. Read `bootstrap.json` to understand the framework configuration
2. Review `Bootstrap.md` for detailed algorithmic specifications and compliance requirements
3. Check loading sequence and entry points
4. Validate user consent and settings
5. Only load enabled rule integrations

## Rule Integration Requirements
Each rule provides specific algorithmic implementations that agents must actively execute:

### Memory Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `memory_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `memory-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Memory initialization, storage, retrieval, and cleanup processes
- Requires: Proper path configuration and retention policies

### RAG Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `rag_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `rag-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Context optimization, relevance scoring, and retrieval algorithms
- Requires: Context window configuration and scoring thresholds

### Critical Thinking Rules Integration
**MANDATORY**: If `critical_thinking_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json
- Location: `critical-thinking-rules/AGENTS.md`
- Implements: Error admission, assumption challenge, and verification processes
- Requires: Verification thresholds and error handling settings

## Framework Isolation
**CRITICAL**: This framework remains a tool and should never be included in user project codebases. All integrations happen through the rule files in their respective directories.

## Agent Responsibility
Agents using this framework must:
- Respect all user settings and configurations
- Provide clear feedback when rules are disabled
- Maintain framework neutrality in generated content
- Follow bootstrap compliance requirements

**VIOLATION**: Agents that do not respect these integration requirements or user settings.
