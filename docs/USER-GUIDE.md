## 🎯 What Each Rule Does

### 🧠 Memory Rules
- Remembers important information across conversations
- Maintains context between sessions
- Helps AI learn from past interactions

### 📚 RAG Rules
- Finds relevant information from your files
- Optimizes how AI reads and processes information
- Improves response accuracy with better context

### 🤔 Critical Thinking Rules
- Makes AI double-check its answers
- Reduces mistakes and "hallucinations"
- Promotes more careful and accurate responses

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Setup Won't Open
- Try right-clicking `setup.html` and selecting "Open with" your web browser
- Make sure you're opening the file from the extracted folder, not from within a ZIP archive

### Files Won't Save
- Check that your browser has permission to save files
- Try using the **📥 Download** option first, then move files manually

### Language Not Changing
- Refresh the page after changing the language
- Clear your browser cache if translations don't appear

## 💡 Tips

- **Start Simple**: Begin with just 1-2 rules to understand how they work
- **Test Gradually**: Try your AI agent with the new rules on simple tasks first
- **Backup First**: Save your existing AI configurations before adding new rules
- **Experiment**: Different combinations of rules work better for different types of tasks
