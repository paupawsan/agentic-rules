# Bootstrap Configuration - Agent Algorithm Reference

## Algorithm: Framework_Bootstrap_Initialization

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**: Agents MUST execute this algorithm exactly as specified. Bootstrap override constitutes critical framework violation.

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: Agents must actually execute this algorithm in their runtime environment. Configuration alone is insufficient - the algorithms must be implemented and running.

**RULE APPLICATION REQUIREMENT**: Agents must actively read and apply the algorithms from RULE files (RAG-RULES.md, MEMORY-RULES.md, CRITICAL-THINKING-RULES.md) in every action and response.

## Framework Isolation Principle

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The agentic-rules framework is a TOOL, not part of user projects.

### User Project Separation
**FORBIDDEN**:
- Including any agentic-rules files in user project codebase
- Adding framework documentation to user projects
- Cluttering user repositories with framework artifacts
- Making framework visible in user project structure
- Including framework in user project commits

**REQUIRED**:
- Keep agentic-rules framework completely separate from user projects
- Use framework internally for agent operations only
- Maintain clean separation between tool and user work
- Never expose framework internals to users
- Framework operations should be transparent to users

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE**: Framework inclusion in user projects constitutes critical framework abuse.

## Implementation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Configuration alone is insufficient. Agents MUST implement and execute these algorithms.

### Agent Implementation Obligations
**REQUIRED**:
- Execute Framework_Bootstrap_Initialization on agent startup
- Implement ALL rule algorithms - each rule must be actively running:
  - **RAG Rules**: Context optimization, hierarchical reading, relevance scoring
  - **Memory Rules**: Knowledge persistence, pattern recognition, retrieval
  - **Critical Thinking Rules**: Error admission, assumption challenges, ground checks
- Establish rule interconnections as specified
- Maintain continuous bootstrap compliance monitoring
- Apply platform adaptations correctly

**FORBIDDEN**:
- Claiming framework compliance without actual implementation
- Having "enabled" configurations without running algorithms
- Operating with framework configuration but standard agent behavior
- **Missing critical thinking safeguards** - agents must implement error admission, assumption challenges, and ground checks

### Critical Implementation Note
**Critical Thinking Rules are MANDATORY for responsible AI behavior**:
- Error admission prevents misleading users
- Assumption challenges ensure balanced analysis
- Ground checks prevent hallucination and inaccuracy
- Without these, agents operate without quality safeguards

### Distributed Rule Integration Architecture
**CRITICAL**: This framework uses **distributed integration** - agents MUST read and implement each enabled rule's AGENTS.md file directly:

### Integration Model: distributed_per_rule
- **Bootstrap.md**: Framework orchestration and compliance (this file)
- **Web Setup Interface**: `setup.html` provides guided configuration and generates final AGENTS.md files
- **{rule-directory}/AGENTS.md**: Specific rule implementation algorithms (generated by web interface)

### Mandatory Rule Integration Files:
- **memory-rules/AGENTS.md**: Memory system integration algorithms (generated by `setup.html` if memory_rules.enabled = true)
- **rag-rules/AGENTS.md**: Context optimization algorithms (generated by `setup.html` if rag_rules.enabled = true)
- **critical-thinking-rules/AGENTS.md**: Critical analysis algorithms (generated by `setup.html` if critical_thinking_rules.enabled = true)

**Agents must READ the specific AGENTS.md files for enabled rules and APPLY ALL algorithms specified, not just acknowledge configuration.**

### Priority Coordination
- **Main Agent/Orchestrator**: Responsible for overall rule priorities and coordination
- **Individual Agents**: Responsible for implementing their assigned rule algorithms
- **Sub-agents**: Follow main agent priorities while implementing rule-specific algorithms

### Bootstrap Context Verification (MANDATORY - Execute First)
**Algorithm: Verify_Bootstrap_Context**
```
1. Check for initialization marker file (.agentic_initialized)
2. IF marker file exists and is valid:
   - Skip user consent prompts for standard initialization
   - Proceed directly to configuration validation
   - Log: "Framework previously initialized - skipping consent prompts"
3. IF marker file is MISSING or INVALID:
   - Display user prompt: "Bootstrap configuration not found. Initialize Agentic Rules Framework? (y/n)"
   - REQUIRE explicit user approval before proceeding
   - IF user approves: Execute Framework_Bootstrap_Initialization
   - IF user declines: Terminate framework operations
4. IF bootstrap context exists: Validate integrity and version compatibility
5. IF validation fails: Display user prompt: "Bootstrap configuration corrupted. Reload framework? (y/n)"
6. REQUIRE user confirmation for any bootstrap reload operations
7. FORBIDDEN: Operate without valid bootstrap context
```

**MANDATORY**: Execute Verify_Bootstrap_Context before any framework operation.

### Input Parameters
- `bootstrap_path`: Path to bootstrap.json configuration file (default: "bootstrap.json")
- `agent_capabilities`: Available tools and platform features
- `user_context`: Current user session and permissions
- `bootstrap_context`: Current loaded bootstrap configuration (if any)

### Bootstrap Compliance Requirements

#### 1. Bootstrap Context Verification (MANDATORY - Always Execute First)
**Algorithm: Verify_Bootstrap_Context** (See above - Execute before any framework operation)

#### 2. Framework Loading Sequence (MANDATORY)
**Algorithm: Load_Framework_Components**
```
0. Execute Verify_Bootstrap_Context (MANDATORY prerequisite)
1. Parse bootstrap.json into configuration object
2. Validate framework version compatibility
3. EXECUTE LOADING SEQUENCE DYNAMICALLY FROM CONFIGURATION:
   FOR each step in bootstrap.loading_sequence (in order):
     - Read step.action, step.required, step.condition, etc.
     - IF step.condition exists (e.g., "not_initialized"):
       - Check initialization status before executing
       - SKIP step if condition not met
     - Execute the specified action according to step configuration
     - REQUIRE user approval for steps with user_approval_required: true
     - FORBIDDEN: Skip required steps or bypass user consent requirements
     - FORBIDDEN: Auto-enable components without explicit user approval

4. Load configuration files specified in bootstrap.entry_points
5. Apply platform adapters from bootstrap.platform_adapters
6. Set up rule interconnections from bootstrap.rule_interconnections
7. Create initialization marker file (.agentic_initialized) on successful completion
8. Run framework validation from bootstrap.framework_validation
9. Log all bootstrap compliance actions
10. Return initialized framework or error if compliance violated
```

#### 2. Rule Interconnection Management
**Algorithm: Process_Rule_Interconnections**
```
FOR each interconnection in bootstrap.rule_interconnections:
  - Validate source_rule and target_rule are loaded
  - Set up data flow according to data_mapping
  - Monitor trigger_condition for activation
  - FORBIDDEN: Bypass or modify interconnections without bootstrap approval
```

#### 3. Platform Adaptation
**Algorithm: Apply_Platform_Adapters**
```
1. Detect current platform (cursor, vscode, ci_system, etc.)
2. Load platform-specific configuration from platform_adapters[platform]
3. Apply platform-specific paths and feature mappings
4. Validate platform compatibility
5. FORBIDDEN: Use non-adapted configurations
```

#### 4. Framework Validation
**Algorithm: Validate_Framework_Integrity**
```
1. Check all required_config_files exist and are valid JSON
2. Check all required_rule_files exist and are readable
3. Verify bootstrap_compliance settings are respected
4. Run all validation_checks including bootstrap_compliance_verification
5. Log validation results
6. CRITICAL: Abort initialization if validation fails
```

### Bootstrap Compliance Violations

**IMMEDIATE TERMINATION REQUIRED for violations:**
- Operating without bootstrap context verification
- Skipping Verify_Bootstrap_Context execution
- Failing to prompt user for bootstrap initialization
- Allowing framework operations without valid bootstrap context
- **Including agentic-rules framework files in user project codebase**
- **Cluttering user projects with framework documentation or code**
- Skipping loading sequence steps
- Bypassing user consent prompts
- Auto-enabling disabled rules
- Modifying bootstrap configuration
- Ignoring rule interconnections
- Bypassing platform adaptations
- Skipping validation checks
- Not maintaining bootstrap context throughout session

### Runtime Compliance Monitoring

**Algorithm: Monitor_Bootstrap_Compliance**
```
WHILE framework is active:
  - Log all rule activation attempts
  - Verify user consent for all rule changes
  - Monitor interconnection data flows
  - Validate platform adaptation usage
  - CONTINUOUSLY verify bootstrap context availability
  - IF bootstrap context lost: Execute Verify_Bootstrap_Context immediately
  - Report compliance violations immediately
  - CRITICAL: Suspend framework on repeated violations
```

### Bootstrap Context Maintenance

**Algorithm: Maintain_Bootstrap_Context**
```
MANDATORY: Execute continuously throughout agent session

1. Monitor bootstrap context presence in agent memory
2. On context loss detection:
   - Log context loss event
   - Display user prompt: "Bootstrap context lost. Reload framework configuration? (y/n)"
   - IF user approves: Execute Framework_Bootstrap_Initialization
   - IF user declines: Deactivate all framework operations
3. Validate bootstrap integrity on major context changes
4. Maintain bootstrap context priority in agent memory management
5. FORBIDDEN: Allow framework operations without valid bootstrap context
```

### Configuration Reference

**Primary Configuration**: `bootstrap.json`
- Contains all framework settings and requirements
- Defines loading sequence and priorities
- Specifies rule interconnections and platform adaptations
- MANDATORY: Read and respect all configuration values

**Dynamic Configuration Loading**:
- Settings files are determined by `entry_points` configuration
- Rule algorithm files are determined by `required_rule_files` validation
- Loading priorities are defined by `loading_sequence` steps
- File paths and requirements are dynamically configured, not hardcoded
