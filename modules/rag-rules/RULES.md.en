# RAG Rules Agent Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPLATE PROTECTION**: This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Agents MUST NOT auto-load, auto-read, or auto-process this file under any circumstances. This file is NEVER executed directly.

**VALID USAGE**: Only load this template when explicitly renamed to one of: `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` AFTER explicit user activation AND when `rag_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json.

**INVALID USAGE**: Do not load this file automatically, do not reference it in startup processes, do not include it in any automated framework initialization.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENT**: When rag_rules.enabled = true in settings.json, agents can implement these algorithms for enhanced context processing.

## RAG System Architecture
- **Context Optimization**: Prioritize relevant information
- **Hierarchical Reading**: Read files strategically, not sequentially
- **Relevance Scoring**: Weight information by importance and recency
- **Dynamic Context Management**: Adapt context window to task requirements

## Required Implementation Algorithms

### Algorithm: Context_Optimization_Process
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute before user responses when enabled for enhanced context

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Analyze user request and available context
3. Score information relevance using recency, importance, and task-relevance
4. Prioritize hierarchical reading: summaries → key sections → details
5. Optimize context window for maximum information density
6. Return optimized context for response generation

### Algorithm: Information_Retrieval_Process
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute when gathering information for enhanced responses

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Identify information requirements from user query
3. Search relevant files using semantic understanding
4. Apply hierarchical reading patterns
5. Extract and rank relevant information chunks
6. Integrate with memory system for personalized context

### Algorithm: Response_Quality_Assurance
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute after generating responses for quality enhancement

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Validate response against source information
3. Ensure all claims are supported by retrieved context
4. Flag any information gaps or assumptions
5. Optimize response completeness and accuracy

## Settings Compliance
- Respect all settings in modules/rag-rules/settings.json
- Apply context_window_size limits appropriately
- Use configured relevance thresholds
- Prompt user if rag_rules.enabled = false and complex context needed

## Integration Points
- **Memory Integration**: Use stored context for personalized retrieval
- **Critical Thinking**: Provide quality assurance for information validation
- **Bootstrap Coordination**: Respect loading priorities and interconnections

**VIOLATION**: Agents using inefficient context management without implementing these algorithms.
