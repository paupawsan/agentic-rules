# RAG Rules Agent Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPLATE PROTECTION**: This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Agents MUST NOT auto-load, auto-read, or auto-process this file under any circumstances. This file is NEVER executed directly.

**VALID USAGE**: Only load this template when explicitly renamed to one of: `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` AFTER explicit user activation AND when `rag_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json.

**INVALID USAGE**: Do not load this file automatically, do not reference it in startup processes, do not include it in any automated framework initialization.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENT**: When rag_rules.enabled = true in settings.json, agents can implement these algorithms for enhanced context processing.

## RAG System Architecture
- **Context Optimization**: Prioritize relevant information
- **Hierarchical Reading**: Read files strategically, not sequentially
- **Relevance Scoring**: Weight information by importance and recency
- **Dynamic Context Management**: Adapt context window to task requirements

## Required Implementation Algorithms

### Algorithm: Context_Optimization_Process
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute before user responses when enabled for enhanced context

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Analyze user request and available context
3. Score information relevance using recency, importance, and task-relevance
4. Prioritize hierarchical reading: summaries → key sections → details
5. Optimize context window for maximum information density
6. Return optimized context for response generation

### Algorithm: Information_Retrieval_Process
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute when gathering information for enhanced responses

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Identify information requirements from user query
3. Search relevant files using semantic understanding
4. Apply hierarchical reading patterns
5. Extract and rank relevant information chunks
6. Integrate with memory system for personalized context

### Algorithm: Response_Quality_Assurance
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute after generating responses for quality enhancement

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true
2. Validate response against source information
3. Ensure all claims are supported by retrieved context
4. Flag any information gaps or assumptions

### Algorithm: Runtime_Knowledge_Graph_Generation
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute during conversations and document processing for dynamic learning

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and knowledge_graph.enabled = true
2. Extract entities, relationships, and concepts from current conversation/document
3. Identify semantic relationships between extracted elements
4. Update runtime knowledge graph with new connections and patterns
5. Strengthen existing relationships based on frequency and recency
6. Prune outdated or weakly connected nodes to maintain graph efficiency
7. Store graph state for persistence across sessions

### Algorithm: Knowledge_Graph_Query_Enhancement
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute during information retrieval to leverage learned relationships

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and knowledge_graph.enabled = true
2. Analyze user query for entities and concepts
3. Query knowledge graph for related information and connections
4. Identify indirect relationships and inference paths
5. Retrieve contextually related information beyond direct keyword matches
6. Rank results using graph centrality and relationship strength
7. Integrate graph-enhanced results with traditional RAG retrieval

### Algorithm: Self_Learning_Pattern_Recognition
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute periodically to identify and learn recurring patterns

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and self_learning.enabled = true
2. Analyze conversation patterns and user interaction styles
3. Identify frequently occurring entity relationships and topics
4. Discover user preferences and communication patterns
5. Update behavior patterns in knowledge graph
6. Adapt response strategies based on learned patterns
7. Generate insights for improved future interactions

### Algorithm: Knowledge_Graph_Integration_with_RAG
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute to combine graph-based learning with traditional RAG processes

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and knowledge_graph.enabled = true
2. Process user query through both traditional RAG and knowledge graph
3. Merge results using intelligent ranking based on:
   - Graph relationship strength
   - Traditional relevance scoring
   - Recency and importance factors
4. Generate enriched context combining structured knowledge and unstructured text
5. Update knowledge graph with new relationships discovered during query processing
6. Provide comprehensive response with both factual and relational context
5. Optimize response completeness and accuracy

## Settings Compliance
- Respect all settings in modules/rag-rules/settings.json
- Apply context_window_size limits appropriately
- Use configured relevance thresholds
- Prompt user if rag_rules.enabled = false and complex context needed

## Integration Points
- **Memory Integration**: Use stored context for personalized retrieval
- **Critical Thinking**: Provide quality assurance for information validation
- **Bootstrap Coordination**: Respect loading priorities and interconnections

**VIOLATION**: Agents using inefficient context management without implementing these algorithms.
