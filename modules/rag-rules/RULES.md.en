# RAG Rules Agent Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPLATE PROTECTION**: This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Agents MUST NOT auto-load, auto-read, or auto-process this file under any circumstances. This file is NEVER executed directly.

**VALID USAGE**: Only load this template when explicitly renamed to one of: `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` AFTER explicit user activation AND when `rag_rules.enabled = true` in settings.json.

**INVALID USAGE**: Do not load this file automatically, do not reference it in startup processes, do not include it in any automated framework initialization.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENT**: When rag_rules.enabled = true in settings.json, agents can implement these algorithms for enhanced context processing.

## RAG System Architecture
- **Context Optimization**: Prioritize relevant information
- **Hierarchical Reading**: Read files strategically, not sequentially

Algorithm: Incremental_Graph_Builder
1. Add new entities as nodes with type and attribute metadata
2. Add relationships as directed/undirected edges with confidence metadata
3. Apply graph consistency checks and optimization
4. Persist graph state with timestamp metadata:
   - If memory_rules.enabled = true: Store in persistent memory system
   - If memory_rules.enabled = false: Store in session-only context

### Algorithm: Knowledge_Graph_Query_Enhancement
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute during information retrieval to leverage learned relationships

**Steps**:

5. Return top-ranked results with explanation metadata

Algorithm: Adaptive_Graph_Maintenance
1. Analyze usage patterns and apply aging/pruning rules
2. Perform graph restructuring and optimization
3. Optimize for query performance with updated indices
4. Persist optimized graph state:
   - If memory_rules.enabled = true: Update stored graph data in persistent memory
   - If memory_rules.enabled = false: Maintain graph in session context only
5. Generate maintenance report with statistics
```

### Algorithm: Self_Learning_Pattern_Recognition
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute periodically to identify and learn recurring patterns

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and self_learning.enabled = true
2. Analyze conversation patterns and user interaction styles
3. Identify frequently occurring entity relationships and topics
4. Discover user preferences and communication patterns
5. Update behavior patterns in knowledge graph
6. Adapt response strategies based on learned patterns
7. Generate insights for improved future interactions

### Algorithm: Knowledge_Graph_Integration_with_RAG
**AVAILABLE**: Can execute to combine graph-based learning with traditional RAG processes

**Steps**:
1. Check rag_rules.enabled = true and knowledge_graph.enabled = true
2. Process user query through both traditional RAG and knowledge graph
3. Merge results using intelligent ranking based on:
   - Graph relationship strength
   - Traditional relevance scoring
   - Recency and importance factors
4. Generate enriched context combining structured knowledge and unstructured text
5. Update knowledge graph with new relationships discovered during query processing
6. Provide comprehensive response with both factual and relational context
5. Optimize response completeness and accuracy

## Settings Compliance
- Respect all settings in modules/rag-rules/settings.json
- Apply context_window_size limits appropriately
- Use configured relevance thresholds
- Prompt user if rag_rules.enabled = false and complex context needed

## Integration Points
- **Memory Integration**: Use stored context for personalized retrieval
- **Critical Thinking**: Provide quality assurance for information validation
- **Bootstrap Coordination**: Respect loading priorities and interconnections

**VIOLATION**: Agents using inefficient context management without implementing these algorithms.
