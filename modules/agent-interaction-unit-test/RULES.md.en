# Agent Interaction Unit Test Agent Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ CRITICAL TEMPLATE PROTECTION**: This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Agents MUST NOT auto-load, auto-read, or auto-process this file under any circumstances. This file is NEVER executed directly.

**VALID USAGE**: Only load this template when explicitly renamed to one of: `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` AFTER explicit user activation AND when `agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true` in settings.json.

**INVALID USAGE**: Do not load this file automatically, do not reference it in startup processes, do not include it in any automated framework initialization.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENT**: When agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true in settings.json, agents can implement these algorithms for enhanced behavior.

## Agent Interaction Unit Test Overview
Automated validation and testing framework for agent conversations with maximum transparency and ground check requirements, specifically designed for testing agent interaction patterns.

## Required Implementation Algorithms

**FRAMEWORK OPTION**: When agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true in settings.json, agents can implement algorithms from `CORE-RULES.md` for enhanced behavior.

See [CORE-RULES.md](CORE-RULES.md) for detailed algorithm specifications.

## Settings Compliance
- Respect all settings in modules/agent-interaction-unit-test/settings.json
- Enable/disable via settings toggle (default: false)
- Prompt user if agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = false and unit testing requested
- Never auto-enable testing mode without explicit user consent

## Integration Points
- **Memory Integration**: Store test results and validation history
- **RAG Integration**: Optimize context for testing scenarios
- **Critical Thinking**: Provide ground check validation support
- **Debugging Analysis**: Execute AgentDebuggingAnalysis_Process for systematic agent behavior analysis (see CORE-RULES.md)
- **Bootstrap Coordination**: Respect loading priorities and rule sequencing

## Usage Instructions

### For Unit Testing:
1. Set `agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true` in settings.json
2. Execute agent with test case
3. Review compliance report for validation criteria
4. Check ground check coverage and error detection
5. Validate tool call transparency and decision documentation

### Test Case Format:
```
UNIT TEST: [Test_Name]
Framework: Agentic Rules v1.2.0
Task: [Specific_Test_Task]

[Execute with unit test validation...]
```

### Validation Criteria:
- ✅ **100% Framework Compliance** - All algorithms executed
- ✅ **100% Ground Check Coverage** - All claims verified
- ✅ **0% Hallucinations** - All information source-verified
- ✅ **Complete Tool Transparency** - Every call logged
- ✅ **Decision Process Documentation** - All choices explained

## Error Handling
**FRAMEWORK GUIDANCE**: When using framework features, agents can handle framework-related errors transparently while respecting standard error handling limits:
- Configuration file missing → Skip unit test operations gracefully
- Invalid settings → Use default values and continue with warnings
- System errors → Continue operation without unit test features
- Test failures → Document issues and provide correction guidance when appropriate

**ERROR HANDLING LIMITS**: Respect standard constraints (maximum 3 attempts per error, avoid uneducated guesses, ask user for unclear issues)

## Framework Integration
**FRAMEWORK DESIGN**: This framework is designed as a tool to enhance agent behavior. Framework components remain separate from user project codebases.

## Agent Enhancement
Agents using this framework can benefit from enhanced capabilities while maintaining natural interaction patterns:
- Respecting user settings and configurations when features are enabled
- Providing transparent feedback about active enhancements
- Maintaining natural, conversational communication without exposing internal mechanics
- Following framework guidance seamlessly in the background
- Enhanced accuracy and reliability through optional structured validation

**FRAMEWORK BENEFITS**: Improved agent behavior through transparent, optional enhancements that don't interfere with natural user interactions.
