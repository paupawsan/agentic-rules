# Agent Interaction Unit Test Agent Integration

<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_START -->
**⚠️ SAFETY PRECAUTION**: This is a TEMPLATE file. Agents MUST NOT auto-load this file. Only load when renamed to `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, OR `CLAUDE.md` after explicit user activation AND when `agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true` in settings.json.
<!-- SAFETY_PRECAUTION_END -->

**MANDATORY**: If agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true in settings.json, agents MUST implement all algorithms below.

## Agent Interaction Unit Test Overview
Automated validation and testing framework for agent conversations with maximum transparency and ground check requirements, specifically designed for testing agent interaction patterns.

## Required Implementation Algorithms

**MANDATORY**: If agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true in settings.json, agents MUST implement all algorithms in `CORE-RULES.md`.

See [CORE-RULES.md](CORE-RULES.md) for detailed algorithm specifications.

## Settings Compliance
- Respect all settings in modules/agent-interaction-unit-test/settings.json
- Enable/disable via settings toggle (default: false)
- Prompt user if agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = false and unit testing requested
- Never auto-enable testing mode without explicit user consent

## Integration Points
- **Memory Integration**: Store test results and validation history
- **RAG Integration**: Optimize context for testing scenarios
- **Critical Thinking**: Provide ground check validation support
- **Bootstrap Coordination**: Respect loading priorities and rule sequencing

## Usage Instructions

### For Unit Testing:
1. Set `agent_interaction_unit_test.enabled = true` in settings.json
2. Execute agent with test case
3. Review compliance report for validation criteria
4. Check ground check coverage and error detection
5. Validate tool call transparency and decision documentation

### Test Case Format:
```
UNIT TEST: [Test_Name]
Framework: Agentic Rules v1.1.0
Task: [Specific_Test_Task]

[Execute with unit test validation...]
```

### Validation Criteria:
- ✅ **100% Framework Compliance** - All algorithms executed
- ✅ **100% Ground Check Coverage** - All claims verified
- ✅ **0% Hallucinations** - All information source-verified
- ✅ **Complete Tool Transparency** - Every call logged
- ✅ **Decision Process Documentation** - All choices explained

## Error Handling
**MANDATORY**: Agents must handle errors transparently:
- Configuration file missing → Skip unit test operations
- Invalid settings → Use default values and log warnings
- System errors → Continue operation without unit test features
- Test failures → Document issues and provide correction guidance

## Framework Integration
**MANDATORY**: This framework remains a tool and should never be included in user project codebases. All integrations happen through the rule files in their respective directories.

## Agent Responsibility
Agents using this framework must:
- Respect all user settings and configurations
- Provide clear feedback when unit testing is disabled
- Maintain framework neutrality in generated content
- Follow bootstrap compliance requirements
- Admit any testing failures immediately and transparently

**VIOLATION**: Agents that do not respect these integration requirements or user settings.
